# MySQL_CSharp_AutoTable
An asynchronous WinForms application connected to a table in a MySQL database.
The table contains columns: record ID, number, brand, color, mileage, speed. The speed of movement is a random value, regularly updated in the table without "friezes".
You can save a table dump from the database to disk by clicking the "Save" button.
